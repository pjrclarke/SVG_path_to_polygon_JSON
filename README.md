# SVG path to polygon / JSON
A handy tool to help convert SVG paths to polygon and JSON format.

I'm looking to expand on this as much as possible and make it a completely accessible tool for everyone to use.
Feel free to get in touch to talk about how I can improve. 

It has all be created inline to be accessed by anyone as easily as possible.
